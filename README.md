This is a template for building web applications using Express.js, TypeScript, and the EJS view engine. It provides a solid foundation for developing server-side rendered web applications with a focus on maintainability, scalability, and best practices.

## Features

- **TypeScript Integration:** Develop your application with TypeScript's static typing and modern JavaScript features.
- **EJS Templating:** Create dynamic HTML content using EJS templates for server-side rendering.
- **Express.js Framework:** Utilize the simplicity and flexibility of the Express.js framework for building web applications.
- **Well-Organized Structure:** A structured project layout with dedicated directories for routes, views, and static assets.
- **Docker Support:** A Dockerfile for containerization, enabling deployment to container orchestration platforms.
- **Development and Production Modes:** Configure the project to run in different environments with environment-specific settings.
- **Static Assets:** Serve static assets (e.g., stylesheets, scripts) for enhancing your application's user interface.
- **Customizable Views:** Customize views and templates using EJS to tailor the visual representation of your application.
- **Middleware Examples:** Demonstrations of using middleware for tasks such as authentication, error handling, and request processing.
- **Environment Variables:** Manage configuration and secrets using environment variables for improved security and configurability.
